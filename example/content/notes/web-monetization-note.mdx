title: Web Monetization test note

This site demonstrates the integration of [Gatsby Web Monetization Theme](https://github.com/ekafyi/gatsby-theme-web-monetization/) in a basic blog site using Gatsbyâ€™s official starter.

Visitors with Web Monetization enabled on their browser will stream _micro payments_ to you as they browse the site. In exchange, you can provide exclusive content for your web monetized users.

With this theme, you can add Web Monetization-related components to your MDX pages like this. _No need to import anything!_

<WebMonetizedStatus
  inactive={<strong>ðŸ˜” Web Monetization is not running</strong>}
  style={{ marginBottom: 32 }}
/>

<WebMonetizedPaywall />

<IfWebMonetized>

Special content just for you. _Yes, you._

</IfWebMonetized>

This theme should not interfere with other themes/plugins that supply MDX components, for example [gatsby-mdx-embed](https://gatsby-mdx-embed.netlify.com/), which lets us embed the YouTube video below.
